You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. **Go ahead** and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Perhaps we should just try to make this introductory paragraph a little longer so that we can see how more text looks in the first paragraph? Do a lot of blogs have a bigger first paragraph? Probably not, I think it's a good thing that I was able to avoid it.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

> This is now a blockquote. Let's see if we have anything to handle these things in Jekyll? How about if we make it a little longer? We're going to need to make it very long for it to show up properly. After all, it's going to be the full width of my screen, is it not?
